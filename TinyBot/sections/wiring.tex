If you just want to see the wiring schematic, see Figure \ref{fig:schematic-hbridge}. Continue reading for an explanation of the L293D H-Bridge and of the circuit. 

\bigskip

Before starting construction on any project, it is always a good idea to wire up the circuit on a flat breadboard and Arduino; as it is far easier to build the circuit on its own before putting together all the parts. \\

Make sure to check which wire is the positive wire on the motor you have, it should be written on the back plate of the motor. Plugging the motor in backwards will not break anything, the motor will just spin backwards. 

Swapping the motor direction can be done by swapping the green and yellow wires attached to the motor. 
% It is mainly important to ensure that the motors spin in the same direction.
